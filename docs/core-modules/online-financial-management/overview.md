# Overview

The online financial management module is responsible for everything related to money in Just Driving: invoices, payments, balances, and financial visibility for both schools and students. It ties together bookings, lesson delivery, and external systems so the financial picture always reflects what has actually happened.

## Purpose and scope

The finance module exists to:

- Turn teaching activity and school offerings into clear, trackable charges.
- Record payments from students and other payers, regardless of method.
- Show up-to-date balances, outstanding amounts, and financial history.
- Connect to external payment gateways and accounting systems when configured.

Operational modules (administration, booking, learning) may trigger financial events, but the finance module holds the authoritative record of who owes what, what has been paid, and what remains open.

## Core financial elements

The module centers on a few key elements:

- Student-level finance  
  - Invoices for packages, individual lessons, fees, and materials.  
  - Payments from students via online gateways or manual methods.  
  - Balances that show whether a student is in debt, up to date, or in credit.

- School-level finance  
  - Aggregated overviews of revenue, open invoices, and payment status.  
  - Visibility into which products or services generate income.  
  - Support for exporting or syncing data to external accounting tools.

- Operational links  
  - Bookings and participation driving what should be billed.  
  - Cancellations, changes, and no-shows affecting adjustments and fees.  
  - Learning progress sometimes tied to financial milestones (for example, packages or modules that must be paid before booking further lessons).

## How other modules interact with finance

The finance module sits in the middle of several flows:

- Administration  
  - Defines which payment options and rules apply per school.  
  - Controls who can see and manage financial data.

- Booking  
  - Provides the context for what is chargeable: scheduled lessons, classes, and cancellations.  
  - Can automatically generate or update financial records based on real activity.

- Learning  
  - May influence billing for specific courses or theory packages.  
  - Helps explain why an invoice exists (which course or package it relates to).

- Integrations  
  - Payment gateways handle online payments and send back confirmations.  
  - Accounting systems receive invoice and payment data for official bookkeeping.  
  - Notification systems inform students and staff about invoices, payments, and reminders.

## Daily use and outcomes

In everyday work, the finance module is used to:

- Create and manage invoices when students sign up, change plans, or complete additional services.
- Record and reconcile payments, ensuring each payment is linked to the correct student and school.
- Monitor overdue amounts and trigger reminders or follow-up actions.
- Provide schools with enough financial insight to run their business without leaving the platform for every small question.

The overall goal is to give schools and students a clear, consistent financial picture that matches the real teaching and booking activity managed elsewhere in Just Driving.
