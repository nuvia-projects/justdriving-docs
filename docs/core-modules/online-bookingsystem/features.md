# Features

The online booking system provides all the tools needed to schedule, manage, and track lessons and classes for driving schools on Just Driving. These features are designed to be flexible enough for different school setups while staying easy to use.

## Scheduling and calendar features

- Central calendar for schools, teachers, and (where allowed) students to schedule lessons and classes.  
- Support for both one-on-one driving lessons and group theory sessions.  
- Time slot management with start/end times, lesson type, location, and participants.  
- Visibility filters so users can view calendars by teacher, student, vehicle, or department.

## Availability and booking rules

- Teacher availability management to define when each teacher can be booked.  
- Optional constraints for resources like cars or rooms to prevent double-booking.  
- School-defined booking rules, including:  
  - How far into the future bookings can be made.  
  - Minimum notice period before a lesson can be booked or cancelled.  
  - Limits on how many active bookings a student can hold.

## Student and teacher self-service

- Student access to view their upcoming and past lessons in a clear schedule.  
- Optional self-service booking and rescheduling capabilities, controlled by school policy.  
- Teacher views showing their daily, weekly, and monthly schedules at a glance.  
- Easy tools for teachers to confirm attendance and mark no-shows.

## Status management and changes

- Booking statuses such as draft, confirmed, completed, cancelled, and no-show.  
- Clear rules for who can change status (students, teachers, school staff) and under what conditions.  
- Support for rescheduling and cancellation flows that respect school-defined rules and potential fees.  
- Audit-friendly tracking of who made which changes and when.

## Notifications and reminders

- Automatic confirmation messages when bookings are created or changed.  
- Reminder notifications before lessons, sent via email and optionally SMS, according to school configuration.  
- Cancellation and change alerts to keep students and teachers synchronized when plans change.  
- Configurable templates so schools can adapt tone and content to their own communication style.

## Integration with other modules

- Tight integration with the financial system to:  
  - Trigger invoicing or charging based on booked or completed lessons.  
  - Apply fees or policies for late cancellations and no-shows.  
- Links to the learning system so completed bookings can contribute to lesson plan progress and required signatures.  
- Use of the administration module’s structure (schools, departments, users) to ensure proper scoping and access control.

Together, these features make the Online Bookingsystem a central, reliable tool for coordinating all lesson-related activity in Just Driving.
