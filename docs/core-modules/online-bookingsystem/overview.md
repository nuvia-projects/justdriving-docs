# Overview

The online booking system handles all scheduling and calendar-related activity in Just Driving. It connects students, teachers, schools, and lesson types so that practical and theory lessons can be planned, changed, and completed in a controlled way.

## Purpose and scope

The booking system exists to:

- Provide a clear way to schedule, reschedule, and cancel lessons and classes.
- Ensure bookings respect school rules, teacher availability, and capacity limits.
- Give students and teachers an up-to-date view of upcoming lessons.
- Supply reliable data to other modules, especially financial management and learning/progress tracking.

It is the operational “calendar engine” of the platform, turning plans and availability into concrete lessons.

## Core booking elements

The module revolves around a few key elements:

- Time slots and sessions  
  - Individual lesson times for one or more students.  
  - Group sessions or classes (for example, theory evenings or seminars).  
  - Recurring or one-off bookings, depending on school needs.

- Participants and resources  
  - Students attending the lesson.  
  - Teachers responsible for teaching and signing off.  
  - Optional resources like cars, rooms, or equipment where relevant.

- Booking status and lifecycle  
  - Draft, confirmed, completed, cancelled, or no-show states.  
  - Rules for who can change status and when (student versus staff).

## How other modules interact with bookings

The booking system sits between several other parts of Just Driving:

- Administration  
  - Provides the structural context: schools, departments, teachers, and students.  
  - Defines rules for who can book what, where, and when.

- Finance  
  - Uses bookings as a major input for invoices and charges (for example, completed lessons, cancellation fees).  
  - Reacts to changes in bookings (new, changed, cancelled) to keep financial data accurate.

- Learning  
  - Connects bookings to lesson plans and progress tracking.  
  - Uses completed bookings and attendance to drive signatures and completion records.

- Notifications  
  - Sends confirmations, reminders, and change/cancellation messages for bookings via email and/or SMS.

## Daily use and outcomes

In everyday operations, the booking system is used to:

- Let staff or students schedule driving lessons and classes within defined constraints.
- Give teachers a clear overview of their teaching day, week, and month.
- Allow schools to manage capacity, avoid double-booking, and adjust to changes quickly.
- Provide a reliable record of what actually took place, feeding into finance, learning, and reporting.

The overall goal is to make scheduling transparent and manageable for everyone involved, while ensuring that school policies and constraints are consistently applied.
