# Workflows

This page describes the main workflows supported by the Online Bookingsystem: how students, teachers, and school staff use the calendar in day-to-day operations.

## Schedule a new lesson

1. Identify participants and context  
   - Select the student, teacher, and (if relevant) department or vehicle.  
   - Choose the lesson type (for example, practical driving lesson or theory session).

2. Find an available time  
   - Check the teacher’s availability and school calendar (opening hours, holidays).  
   - Ensure no conflicts with other bookings for the teacher, student, or shared resources.

3. Create and confirm the booking  
   - Set time, duration, location, and any notes.  
   - Save the booking in a confirmed state (or as draft if approval is required).  
   - Trigger notifications so student and teacher see the new lesson in their calendars.

## Reschedule an existing booking

1. Start from the existing booking  
   - Locate the booking in the calendar or in a list view.  
   - Confirm who requested the change (student, teacher, school).

2. Apply booking rules  
   - Check rescheduling rules: minimum notice, limits on changes, and who is allowed to modify.  
   - Ensure the new time respects teacher availability and resource constraints.

3. Update and notify  
   - Change date/time and any related details.  
   - Save the updated booking, preserving history of changes.  
   - Notify all affected participants of the new schedule.

## Cancel a booking

1. Determine who is cancelling and why  
   - Student cancellation, teacher unavailability, or school decision.  
   - Capture optional reason or category (for example, illness, weather, no-show risk).

2. Check cancellation rules  
   - Enforce minimum notice and policy-based restrictions.  
   - Determine whether cancellation fees or special handling apply.

3. Cancel and update downstream modules  
   - Mark the booking as cancelled with appropriate sub-status.  
   - Trigger any related financial or learning logic (for example, fees or rescheduling suggestions).  
   - Inform participants by email/SMS and update calendars.

## Complete a lesson

1. After the lesson time  
   - The teacher reviews the booking in their schedule.  
   - Confirm which students attended (for group sessions) and mark attendance.

2. Update status and records  
   - Set the booking status to completed or no-show as appropriate.  
   - Trigger learning module updates (progress, signatures) based on completion.  
   - Inform the finance module if the booking should generate or confirm charges.

3. Follow-up actions  
   - Optionally schedule follow-up lessons while availability is still visible.  
   - Add notes for future reference (for example, student progress, issues observed).

## Daily and weekly planning

1. Daily start-of-day review  
   - Teachers and staff check the day’s calendar for all upcoming lessons.  
   - Identify special cases (new students, double lessons, weather-sensitive sessions).

2. Adjustments and communication  
   - Make last-minute changes where needed (within policy limits).  
   - Send reminders or confirmations if not already automated.

3. Weekly planning and capacity checks  
   - Review the week’s occupancy per teacher, vehicle, and department.  
   - Adjust availability or open new slots based on demand.  
   - Coordinate with the finance and learning modules to ensure lessons align with student progress and payment status.

These workflows show how the Online Bookingsystem supports the full lifecycle of lessons, from initial scheduling to completion and follow-up, while staying aligned with school rules and the rest of the platform.
