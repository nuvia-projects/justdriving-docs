# Features

The Online Administrationssystem provides the central toolbox school staff use to configure Just Driving, manage users, and keep daily operations under control. This page highlights the main features available to administrators and school owners.

## School and branch management

The administration module lets schools model their real-world structure:

- Create and manage schools with contact information, branding, and legal details.
- Define departments or branches for multi-location schools.
- Configure time zones, locales, and other global settings that affect bookings, notifications, and reporting.
- Enable or disable modules and integrations (for example, online payments, SMS, external platforms) per school.

These features ensure each school instance behaves according to its own rules while still running on the same platform.

## User and role management

The system provides fine-grained control over who can access what:

- Create, invite, edit, and deactivate users (students, teachers, and staff).
- Assign roles such as platform admin, school admin/owner, office staff, teacher, and student.
- Scope users to specific schools and, if used, specific departments or branches.
- Manage role changes over time without losing historical links to bookings, invoices, or progress.

This feature set keeps access up to date as people join, leave, or change roles in the organization.

## Student and teacher administration

Administrators can manage the core teaching relationships:

- Maintain detailed student profiles, including contact details, enrollment status, and school/department membership.
- Maintain teacher profiles, qualifications, and active/inactive status.
- Assign students to teachers, classes, or departments according to school policies.
- Move students or teachers between departments or schools in controlled, auditable ways.

These capabilities keep the underlying data correct so that bookings, progress tracking, and communication work reliably.

## Configuration of operational rules

The admin system centralizes operational settings that affect other modules:

- Define booking rules, such as allowed time windows, cancellation rules, and lead times.
- Configure notifications for email and SMS:
  - Which events trigger messages.
  - Which channels are used.
- Set finance-related preferences:
  - Default invoice behaviors.
  - Payment options made available to students.
- Manage school calendars, holidays, and special periods that affect availability.

Consistent configuration here ensures the booking, finance, and learning modules follow the same rule set.

## Dashboards and overviews

To support daily management, the admin module offers overview tools:

- High-level dashboards showing:
  - Active and new students.
  - Upcoming bookings and occupancy.
  - Basic financial indicators such as open invoices or recent payments.
- Lists and filters for:
  - Students (by status, department, teacher).
  - Teachers (by status, department, utilization).
  - Departments and schools (for platform-level admins).

These views help staff quickly understand what is happening and where attention is needed.

## Audit, security, and compliance features

Because administrative actions can have wide impact, the module includes:

- Traceability for important operations:
  - Role changes.
  - Configuration updates at school level.
  - Significant user data changes.
- Strict enforcement of school and department scoping to prevent cross-school data leaks.
- Support for privacy- and compliance-related actions, such as deactivating or anonymizing user accounts when required by policy or law.

Together, these features make the Online Administrationssystem a secure, reliable control center for the rest of the platform.
