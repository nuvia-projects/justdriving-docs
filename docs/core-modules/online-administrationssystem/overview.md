# Overview

The Online Administrationssystem is the central management interface for schools, teachers, students, and departments in Just Driving. It provides the administrative backbone that schools use to organize their operations, manage users, and oversee the entire teaching and learning process.

## Scope of the administration system

The administration system covers:

- School and department organization and configuration.
- User management for teachers, students, and school staff.
- Access control and permissions across all roles.
- Overview dashboards and reporting for school operations.
- Integration points with other modules (bookings, finance, learning).

This module is the "control center" that ties together the operational aspects of running a driving school, ensuring all users have appropriate access while maintaining data integrity and security.

## Core administrative entities

The system manages these key entities:

- **Schools**  
  The top-level organization representing a driving school. Each school can have:  
  - Basic information (name, address, contact details, tax info).  
  - Configuration (payment settings, notification preferences, branding).  
  - Multiple departments or branches if the school has multiple locations.

- **Departments/Branches**  
  Subdivisions within a school (for example, different locations or specialized programs).  
  Can have their own teachers, students, and schedules while remaining part of the parent school.

- **Users and roles**  
  - **School administrators/owners**: Full access within their school, manage all users and settings.  
  - **Teachers**: Access to their students, bookings, lesson plans, and progress tracking.  
  - **Students**: Access to their own schedule, progress, invoices, and learning materials.  
  - **Platform administrators**: Global access across all schools (for support, billing, system management).

- **User profiles**  
  Detailed information for each user type:  
  - Students: Contact info, driving license status, emergency contacts, payment method preferences.  
  - Teachers: Qualifications, availability, assigned students and classes.  
  - Staff: Role assignments, access permissions, contact information.

## Administrative workflows

Typical day-to-day operations supported by the system include:

- **Onboarding new schools**  
  Setting up a new school account, configuring departments, and establishing initial settings.

- **User management**  
  - Adding new students and teachers to the system.  
  - Assigning students to teachers and departments.  
  - Managing access permissions and role changes.  
  - Handling student transfers between schools or departments.

- **School configuration**  
  - Setting up payment gateways and accounting integrations.  
  - Configuring notification preferences (email, SMS).  
  - Managing school calendars, holidays, and operating hours.  
  - Customizing branding and communication templates.

- **Reporting and oversight**  
  - Dashboard views showing school activity (new students, upcoming bookings, financial status).  
  - User activity reports (login history, access patterns).  
  - Compliance and audit reports for regulatory requirements.

## Access control and scoping

The administration system enforces strict scoping rules:

- **School isolation**: Users can only see and modify data within their school.  
- **Department scoping**: When departments exist, users may be limited to their department's data.  
- **Role-based permissions**: Different roles see different interfaces and have different capabilities.  
- **Audit trails**: Track who made what changes and when for accountability.

## Integration points

The administration system connects with:

- **Booking system**: Manages schedules, classes, and availability based on school configuration.  
- **Financial system**: Links users to invoices, payments, and balances.  
- **Learning system**: Tracks student progress and lesson completion within the school's structure.  
- **External systems**: Configures and monitors integrations with payment gateways, SMS providers, and theory platforms.

## Daily administrative experience

School staff typically use the administration system for:

- Morning: Review today's schedule, check for new bookings or cancellations.  
- Throughout the day: Manage student records, update teacher assignments, handle payment inquiries.  
- End of day: Generate reports, review financial status, prepare for tomorrow.  
- Weekly/Monthly: Run compliance reports, manage user access, review school performance metrics.

The goal is to provide school administrators with a single, comprehensive view of their operations while giving teachers and students appropriate, scoped access to the information they need to do their jobs effectively.
