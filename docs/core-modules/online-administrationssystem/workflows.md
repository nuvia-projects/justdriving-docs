# Workflows

This page describes the main workflows in the Online Administrationssystem: what administrators, school staff, teachers, and students typically do, and how their actions flow through the rest of Just Driving.

## Onboard a new school

This workflow is used when a new driving school starts using the platform.

1. Create the school profile  
   - Register the school with basic details (name, address, contact info, legal/ billing data).  
   - Set the school’s time zone, default language, and any high-level operational settings.

2. Configure structure  
   - Create departments/branches if the school operates in multiple locations.  
   - Define initial staff roles: who is the primary school owner/admin, who is office staff.

3. Set up integrations  
   - Configure payment options (online gateway, manual methods).  
   - Configure email and SMS sending options.  
   - Connect any accounting or theory platforms, if applicable.

4. Verify access and views  
   - Ensure school admins can see the correct dashboards and configuration pages.  
   - Confirm that no other schools’ data is visible.

Once complete, the school can start onboarding teachers and students.

## Onboard a new teacher

This workflow ensures teachers have the correct access to students and schedules.

1. Create or invite the teacher  
   - Add the teacher with contact details.  
   - Assign them to the correct school and, if used, department or branch.

2. Assign role and permissions  
   - Apply the teacher role, and add any extra permissions if the teacher also has administrative duties.  
   - Confirm that the teacher cannot access financial or global configuration screens unless explicitly allowed.

3. Connect to operations  
   - Set teacher availability and link them to relevant classes or student groups.  
   - Ensure the booking system recognizes the teacher as a resource.

4. Validate teacher view  
   - Check that the teacher can log in, see assigned students and bookings, and not see data from other schools or unrelated departments.

## Onboard a new student

This workflow is used whenever a new student starts with the school.

1. Create the student profile  
   - Add contact details and any required information (for example, license status or course type).  
   - Link the student to the correct school and, if applicable, department.

2. Assign relationships  
   - Assign a primary teacher or team, if the school uses such a model.  
   - Add the student to relevant classes, groups, or waiting lists.

3. Connect modules  
   - Ensure the student appears in booking-related views for scheduling lessons.  
   - Connect the student to finance (initial invoices, agreed payment options).  
   - Assign relevant lesson plans or learning content.

4. Communication and access  
   - Ensure the student can log in to the portal.  
   - Confirm that notifications (email/SMS) are configured according to school policy and student preferences.

## Change roles or department

This workflow covers internal changes such as promotions, transfers, or scope adjustments.

1. Identify the change  
   - Determine whether the user’s role, school, department, or combination needs to change.  
   - Check any dependencies (students, bookings, financial responsibilities).

2. Adjust scope and role  
   - Update the user’s role (for example, teacher to school admin) while preserving their history.  
   - Change school or department assignments where necessary.

3. Reassign responsibilities  
   - Reassign students or classes if a teacher’s department changes or a user leaves.  
   - Ensure bookings, invoices, and progress reports continue to have clear responsible parties.

4. Verify access  
   - Confirm that the user now sees the correct data and no longer sees data outside their new scope.  
   - Check that previous data remains intact for reporting and auditing.

## Periodic administrative review

This recurring workflow helps keep the system clean and secure.

1. Review users  
   - Identify inactive or obsolete accounts (teachers or students who have left).  
   - Deactivate users where appropriate, preserving historical links.

2. Review structure  
   - Check that departments and schools are still correctly defined.  
   - Merge or retire branches that no longer exist in the real world.

3. Review permissions  
   - Confirm that only the right people have admin-level access.  
   - Adjust roles for staff whose responsibilities have changed.

4. Review configuration  
   - Revisit booking, finance, and notification settings to ensure they still match school policies.  
   - Update integrations if providers, credentials, or requirements have changed.

These workflows together describe how the Online Administrationssystem is used in practice to keep the platform aligned with the real-world structure and operations of each driving school.```
