# Workflows

This page describes the main workflows in the learning system: how lesson plans are assigned, how progress is updated from real lessons, and how teachers and students collaborate to complete the required training.

## Assign a lesson plan to a new student

1. Enroll the student into the school’s learning program.  
2. Select the appropriate lesson plan or curriculum variant for that student (for example, standard course, intensive course, or special program).  
3. Confirm any prerequisites or prior learning the student already has.  
4. Make the plan visible to both the student and teacher so they can see the upcoming modules and required steps.

## Prepare and deliver a lesson

1. Before the lesson  
   - Teacher reviews the student’s current progress and the modules that are due next.  
   - Teacher selects which plan steps this booking is intended to cover (theory topics or practical skills).

2. During the lesson  
   - Teacher follows the selected modules, adapting in real time as needed.  
   - Notes can be recorded for later reference (strengths, weaknesses, issues to revisit).

3. After the lesson  
   - Teacher marks which modules or steps were fully covered and which need further practice.  
   - Booking status is set to completed or adjusted (for example, partial completion or no‑show).  
   - The student’s progress view is updated accordingly.

## Record progress and signatures

1. Review completed content  
   - Teacher opens the student’s learning record and confirms that the correct modules have been linked to recent lessons.  
   - Any missing links or corrections are applied while the details are still fresh.

2. Add confirmations  
   - Teacher confirms that a module has been delivered to the required standard.  
   - Student, where required, confirms they have received and participated in the training.

3. Lock and audit  
   - Once both sides are satisfied, the step is marked as fully verified.  
   - The system records timestamps and responsible users for audit and regulatory purposes.

## Monitor and support student progress

1. Ongoing monitoring  
   - Teachers and school staff regularly review progress dashboards for their students.  
   - Students view their own progress to understand what remains before exam readiness.

2. Identify issues  
   - Spot students who are falling behind, missing key modules, or repeatedly rescheduling.  
   - Identify areas where additional lessons or support may be needed (for example, specific maneuvers or theory topics).

3. Take action  
   - Plan targeted lessons or extra sessions to close gaps.  
   - Communicate with students about what is required next and why.

## Prepare a student for exams or completion

1. Check completion status  
   - Verify that all required modules and steps are completed and verified according to the plan.  
   - Confirm that any time/order requirements are fulfilled (for example, certain theory topics before particular practical lessons).

2. Resolve outstanding items  
   - Identify any remaining steps or signatures and schedule final lessons if needed.  
   - Ensure there are no contradictions or missing records in the learning history.

3. Mark the program as complete  
   - Once all requirements are met, mark the student’s lesson plan as completed.  
   - Provide clear evidence (reports or summaries) that can be used for internal records or regulatory checks.

These workflows show how the Online Undervisningssystem turns individual lessons into a structured, traceable learning journey from enrollment to exam readiness.
