The Online Undervisningssystem provides the tools needed to structure, deliver, and document the educational journey for driving students, across both theory and practical lessons.

## Lesson plans and curriculum management

- Define structured lesson plans that cover required theory topics and practical skills.  
- Organize content into modules and steps (for example, basic controls, traffic rules, motorway driving).  
- Configure school-specific variations while keeping a common core where appropriate.  
- Set prerequisites between modules so students follow a logical, compliant sequence.

## Student progress tracking

- Maintain per-student progress views showing completed, in-progress, and remaining modules.  
- Link bookings and completed sessions to specific lesson plan elements.  
- Provide teachers and students with a shared understanding of where the student is in the program.  
- Support filtering and summaries for staff (for example, students close to completion, or those falling behind).
