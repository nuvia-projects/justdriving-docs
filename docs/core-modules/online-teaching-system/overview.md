# Overview

The Online Undervisningssystem (learning system) manages the educational side of Just Driving: lesson plans, theory and practical content, progress tracking, and signatures from students and teachers. It is the module that ensures students follow a structured path from first lesson to being ready for tests and real‑world driving.

## Purpose and scope

The learning system exists to:

- Provide structured lesson plans that reflect legal, pedagogical, and school-specific requirements.
- Track each student’s progress through theory and practical modules.
- Coordinate with bookings so attended lessons translate into real progress.
- Capture confirmations and signatures from both teachers and students where required.

It is the educational “backbone” that turns individual lessons into a coherent training program.

## Core learning elements

The module revolves around:

- **Lesson plans and modules**  
  - Structured sequences of topics or steps (for example, theory lessons, maneuvers, road types).  
  - Configurable per school or shared across schools, depending on policy.  
  - Each module can define goals, required activities, and prerequisites.

- **Student progress records**  
  - Per-student tracking of completed, in‑progress, and remaining modules.  
  - Links between specific bookings and the modules they cover.  
  - Visibility for both students and teachers so everyone knows “what’s next”.

- **Signatures and confirmations**  
  - Teacher confirmations that required content has been taught.  
  - Student confirmations that they have received and understood the teaching.  
  - Digital signature flows aligned with local regulatory requirements.

## How other modules interact with the learning system

The learning system is tightly integrated with:

- **Booking system**  
  - Bookings are the real-world sessions where learning happens.  
  - Completed bookings update learning progress and may unlock subsequent modules.  
  - Lesson plans can influence what types of bookings are suggested or allowed next.

- **Administration system**  
  - Defines which lesson plans are available at each school.  
  - Controls who can assign, modify, or complete lesson modules.  
  - Uses school and department structure to scope access to learning records.

- **Finance system**  
  - Uses lesson plans and progress as context for billing (for example, packages that include a certain number of modules).  
  - May restrict access to certain learning content or bookings when payments are overdue, according to school policy.

## Daily use and outcomes

In everyday practice, the learning system is used to:

- Assign appropriate lesson plans to new students when they join a school.  
- Help teachers plan and document each session according to the curriculum.  
- Show students a clear view of what they have completed and what remains.  
- Provide administrators and regulators with reliable evidence that required training has been delivered.

The overall goal is to ensure that training is structured, compliant, and transparent for everyone involved.
