# Platforms

## Just Driving
Just Driving is the core platform that connects driving schools with students and manages the overall relationship between them. It focuses on profiles, bookings, communication, and keeping track of lessons and progress.

## e-teori.dk
e-teori.dk is an external theory-learning platform that provides online theory lessons and practice tests for driving students. In the Just Driving ecosystem, it can be used as the place where students prepare for their theory exam while their practical lessons and communication are handled in Just Driving.

## findkoreskole.dk
findkoreskole.dk is a platform that helps students discover and compare driving schools. Within the Just Driving setup, it can act as an entry point where students find a school, and then are onboarded into Just Driving for ongoing booking, communication, and lesson management.
