# Purpose of the platform


Just Driving is a user-friendly platform that connects driving schools with students, helping schools attract and manage learners while giving students an easier way to get started with driving lessons. By moving key interactions online (searching schools, managing lessons, and communication), it aims to reduce administrative overhead for schools and make the whole learning-to-drive journey more transparent and convenient for students
