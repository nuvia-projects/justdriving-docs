# Purpose of the Platform

Just Driving is a management platform designed to connect driving schools with students and streamline the entire journey from first contact to finished driver’s licence. The system makes it easier for students to find a driving school, book lessons, and follow their progress, while giving schools powerful tools to manage operations, teachers, finances, and communication.

The platform exists to remove the friction and manual work that currently surround scheduling driving lessons. Instead of phone calls, spreadsheets, and scattered messages, Just Driving centralizes bookings, availability, notifications, and lesson tracking in one place. This reduces errors, double bookings, missed lessons, and miscommunication, and creates a clearer experience for both students and instructors.

For driving schools, Just Driving provides a digital backbone for running the business. Schools can manage branches, teachers, students, classes, bookings, lesson plans, and payments through a unified interface. The system supports registering invoices and payments, tracking student balances, and sending automated notifications (such as reminders, confirmations, and updates) via email and SMS, helping schools keep cash flow and communication under control.

For students, the platform offers a modern online experience for getting a driver’s licence. Students can register with a school, see available classes and driving slots, book or manage lessons, receive notifications about upcoming lessons or changes, and keep track of their status and requirements. This reduces uncertainty around “what is the next step?” and gives a transparent overview of where they are in the process.

For developers, the goal of Just Driving is to provide a clear, modular system that can evolve with new features and integrations over time. The platform is organized into well-defined domains such as schools, students, teachers, bookings, lesson plans, education content, finance, and notifications. New developers should quickly understand why the system exists, who it serves, and which core problems every module is trying to solve.
